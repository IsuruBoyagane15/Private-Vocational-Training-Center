      <h3>Welcome to Vocational Training Institute</h3>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Vocational training, also known as Vocational Education and Training (VET) and Career and Technical Education (CTE),
      provides job-specific technical training for work in the trades. These programs generally focus on providing students
      with hands-on instruction, and can lead to certification, a diploma or certificate. Students may prepare for jobs such as
      auto repair, plumbing, retail, etc.</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Vocational training can also give applicants an edge in job searches, since
      they already have the certifiable knowledge they need to enter the field. A student can receive vocational training
      either in high school, a community college or at trade schools for adults.</p>
